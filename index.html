    <h3>Personal History</h3>
    <p class="mdl-typography--body-1">On June 8, 1955, Tim Berners-Lee was born in the United Kingdom. His creation of the World Wide Web, which transformed
    international communication and information exchange, is what made this British computer scientist most famous. Both of
    his parents, Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, were mathematicians who contributed to the early computer's
    development. Having a strong interest in technology from childhood, he went on to become a computer scientist and
    develop the first web browser and server.

  <h3>Contributions</h3>
    <p class="mdl-typography--body-1">The World Wide Web or as many know it as, WWW, which Tim Berners-Lee created in 1989 when he was working at CERN, is his most notable
    contribution.
    <br>
    He created the HTML, HTTP, and URLs technologies that are important to the web. These developments
    revolutionized international communication and information access because it made it possible to create and share web
    pages with ease. He established the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 to create web standards and guarantee that the
    internet is always open and usable by everybody. He also works on initiatives like Solid, which tries to give consumers
    more control over their personal data online, and is a staunch supporter of open data, net neutrality, and internet
    freedom. His efforts have influenced the current internet, increasing accessibility to information and promoting
    interconnectedness worldwide.
